            <li>$3.95 per month (currently on sale from $9.49/month)</li>

        <p2><ul>I would chose to use JustHost as a web host site because it is very affordable, which is a very important factor to me because I am a broke college student. It also offers a variety of included features, such as a free website builder that comes with marketing tools. I would take advantage of the marketing tools since I'd like to fulfill a career in social media marketing. JustHost's website was easier for me to navigate than FatCow's, and it is cheaper than GoDaddy.</ul></p2>
