            <h1>All of the Wonderful Seasons</h1>
            <p>Montana is one of the special places that experiences all four seasons throughout the year. There is no year-round temperature. Instead, Montanans experience the extremes from both ends of the spectrum: the coldest of cold nights, and steaming hot summer days. What is your favorite season? Do you prefer to pair hand warmers and hot chocolate, or light sweaters and pumpkin spice lattes? How about swimsuits and popsicles? Rain jackets and umbrellas?</p>
            <p>Lucky for you, in Montana, you can experience days that include a touch of every season. Some days, you can start wearing a tanktop, end up layering on a rain jacket, then adding a parka, and finally stripping back down to a single layer. Your shoes can change from flip flops to fuzzy boots in a matter of hours in this state. The moral of the story is: never try to predict the weather in Montana.</p>
