            <h1>George's Pals</h1>
            <p><img src="matty.jpg" class="matty">One of George's friends is Mattie. Mattie passed away last year but is forever one of George's best friends. They shared very fond memories of sniffing each other's behinds. RIP Mattie, we love you!</p>
            <p><img src="lola.jpg" class="lola">Lola is not only George's best friend, but also his lover. They are both shih-tzus, and they have been neighbors their whole lives. Nearly every day, either George or Lola sneaks out of the house or backyard and runs across the street to the doorstep of the other dog's house. They have regular playdates. Their favorite game is called "Lola beats up on George and George takes it because he loves her so much." It's more fun for Lola than George. They are soulmates and best friends.</p>
            <p><img src="fourth.jpg" class="fourth">This is George's friend, Sky. Sky is much bigger than George, and sometimes he sits on George. This makes George upset, but they are friends regardless. Sometimes George likes to act intimidating and size up to Sky, but then remembers that he is actually kind of a wimp. This is a picture of them cuddling in a lawn chair on the Fourth of July. (Cuddling is actually just Sky invading George's much desired personal space).</p>
