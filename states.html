    <h1>1. <a href="https://www.nh.gov/index.htm" target="_new" title="NH">New Hampshire</a>
    </h1>
    <p1>This is my favorite state website because of it's layout. The home page is easy to navigate with its organized tabs labeled, "Are you looking for..." and "NH at a glance..." It has a simple, blue color theme. Some downsides to the website are that it is non responsive, so it does not adjust to the screen size of different smart phones or computers. I also thought that it should advertise the actual state name, "New Hampshire" more than it does; the acronym "NH" is posted more frequently and in bigger letters than the full state name, which is weird in my opinion. The viewer should have a clear idea of what the site is advertising right when they access the page. Random factor: there are only 269 lines of coding for the website. </p1>
    <h1>2. <a href="https://www.nebraska.gov/" target="_new" title="NE">Nebraska</a></h1>
    <p1>Nebraska's website is my second favorite because it has a very straight forward approach to navigation, which is extremely important. It is not the most eye-catching website, as its colors are gray and bland. It has an immediate list of options centered at the top of the page, which is helpful but overwhelming. Similar to New Hampshire's website, the initials "NE" appear more on the website than the full state name, "Nebraska" which is misleading to me. A huge advantage of this website is that it is responsive. Random factor: it has around 700 lines of coding.</p1>
    <h1>3. <a href="https://az.gov/half-staff-notices" target="_new" title="AZ">Arizona</a></h1>
    <p1>This is my third preference because it contains a lot of information, but requires a bit of "digging" to find all of it. The website format appears to be simple because it seems to lack options. There are tabs with general information on them, which lead to much more elaborate links. As far as appearance, it has too many pictures throughout the website, in my opinion. It would look more tidy if the website replaced some background images with solid colors. The orange accent color throughout the site clashes with the red "AZ" logo which drives me slightly crazy (I know that is very nit picky). The website is responsive, which is awesome. Random factor: it has 1400 lines of coding.</p1>
    <h1>4. <a href="https://mt.gov/" target="_new" title="MT">Montana</a></h1>
    <p1>Given that Montana's website is responsive, it comes just before Alaska's. This website is very appealing, as its initial colorful background matches well with the neautral gray text boxes. However, the words on each page make it too busy. There should either be less words, or more spacing between them so that it is easier to look at. More visual aids would help to simplify the layout. It is not very easy to navigate because of the cluster of words. The photo and video gallery is a nice addition to the website, as it is a great method of attraction and offers more visual ideas. Random factor: contains 777 lines of coding.</p1>
    <h1>5. <a href="https://education.alaska.gov/alaskan_schools/alaska-district-map" target="_new" title="Alaska">Alaska</a></h1>
    <p1>Alaska's website is my least favorite for several reasons. First, it is not responsive, which is very frustrating for iPhone users whose screens differ from computer screens. The font used throughout the website is very boring to me. The completely blue color theme is also slightly bland and boring. Aside from the legistics, it is well-organized and easy to navigate. Ultimately, it is my least favorite because there is nothing special or eye-cataching about this website. Random factor: it has the most lines of coding out of all the state websites, with 1663 lines.</p1>
