            <title>George's Cutest Stories</title>
            <h1>George's Best Memories</h1>
            <p>My family has countless funny stories about George, but I am going to list a few of our very favorites. George isn't exactly what you would call intelligent. We sometimes joke around that he isn't completely there in the head. Sometimes I start to wonder if the joke is actually real.</p>
            <h2>The Candle Story</h2>
            <p>My mom is the queen of decorating our house with all sorts of stylish decor. One of her favorite decorations to put around our living room is candles. Thankfully, some of the candles have a fake flame. One day, George was being rebelious and standing on top of the table behind our living room couch. There happened to be two candles sitting on rather tall candle holders, on the end of the table. When someone noticed him standing on the table and began to yell at him to get down, he got startled. He swiftly whipped his head around toward the voice, and in the process, managed to knock both of the candles off of the table. The candle holders were wooden and decently heavy, so it made an extremely loud noise when his head smacked them. All of us started screaming because first, we thought the candles were real flames and our dog just set our carpet on fire and second, we thought George for sure had just been concussed. It is still unknown whether George got a concussion from this traumatic event, but the odds are pretty likely.</p>
            <h3>The Piano Bench</h3>
            <p>Just when we thought George couldn't handle any more head injuries, we experienced the piano bench incident. One day, George was playing fetch with his toys. I must clarify, though, that George's version of "fetch" is actually just throwing his toys across the living room and never recieving them back. He doesn't really understand the whole return-the-toy concept. Regardless, one day, I threw George's squeaky weasel (his favorite toy) all the way into the dining room, which is connected to the living room. He began sprinting after his toy, which happened to land directly underneath the piano bench. He picked the weasel up in his mouth, and then began violently shaking his head, the way he does when he has a toy in his mouth. I think this is his version of acting tough. But he was standing a bit too close to the leg of the piano bench, because when he cranked his head to the side with all of his force, he smacked it on the wooden leg. This noise echoed throughout our home, and honestly, probably throughout the neighborhood, too. I thought he cracked the wooden bench because he hit it so hard with his head. He was embarassed, so he dropped the weasel, and walked away to go lay on his bed. George most definitely got an undiagnosed concussion from the piano bench.</p>
