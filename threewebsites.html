    The website for <a href="http://www.billingsunited.net/" target="_new" title="Billings United Soccer Club">Billings United Soccer Club</a> is, in my opinion, not a good website. This was my soccer club in Billings. There are too many color combinations that do not go well together, including green, neon pink, and red. Granted, the colors are there to represent the combining of multiple soccer clubs and brands, but it is displeasing to the eye; maybe soccer clubs should be required to take a web design class to learn about appropriate color schemes. There is not a moving scrolling effect, but the background does appear as an individual layer set behind the main focus of certain sections of the page. The background is a repeating combination of the Billings United logo, the Portland Thorns logo, and the Portland Timbers logo, which makes the overall appearance very busy. There is one main collumn, although as you scroll down the page, the different programs offered through the club are presented in 2 and 3 collumns. Because of the excessive amount of advertisement (clubs, brands, companies, and programs), the layout is very confusing. There is not enough white space, so the overall appearance is overwhelming. Different fonts are used throughout the home page, which does not look clean. On the "About" tab, there is a picture of each coach along with a short description of them. This page looks much more organized and clean. A cool feature about this page of the website is that the pictures have rounded corners. However, the font on this page is unorganized, as some of it is italicised in the middle of a word, and then un-italicised in the other half of the word. The simple errors like this make it look less professional. The code is not clean, it looks very unorganized and crowded.

    In contrast to the first website,
    <a href="https://tjmaxx.tjx.com/store/index.jsp" target="_new" title="TJ Maxx">TJ Maxx</a> has a well-designed site. TJ Maxx is my favorite store, so I spend a decent amount of time each week looking at its website while online shopping. The first noticeably attractive feature about the TJ Maxx website is its color scheme. The red logo is complimented throughout the site, since red is the accent color for many different titles, sections, and fonts. The red color contrasts nicely with the white background color; this ties into the next great feature of the website: the use of white space. There is not too much white space to the point where it is boring to look at, but rather, there is just enough to spread the pages out and make it pleasing to the eye. The layout makes total sense to me, as the menu bar is sorted into straightfoward categories, which makes navigation quick and easy for shoppers (such as myself). There is no scrolling effect, and there is just one main column on the home page. On the pages with clothing items, though, products are displayed in 3 columns. A neat feature about this site is that when you hover over a product, a view of the back side temporarily pops up, so you get more of a 360 degree quick-view. Also, when you hover over menu titles, the font bulges and turns from black to red. This makes it easier to find what a shopper is looking for, because the bold letters make certain sections pop out. The code is much more organized than the first website.

Apple does a great job of marketing because modern technology trends focus on simplicity in design (thin, light-weight, simple design). Their website represents this simplicity, because there is a rather minimal amount of words on the home page. Large, up-close photos of devices take up a majority of the pages, because their focus is largely on the appearance of products. This makes it easy and fun to look at the website. It is easy to navigate because there are so few words; the titles are obvious and stick out at the top. There is no scrolling effect. The number of colums depends on the page. The home page has one column, but pages that display certain products have more (2-3) columns. Apple mainly uses shades of black and white, which gives it a clean, simple look. This draws attention to photography elements such as light, reflection, and shadows, which are very engaging. It also makes the occasional splash of color stand out. The coding is abundant, but organized and clean. I find it interesting how the majority of additional information can be found at the very bottom of the website, rather than having those links at the top; this clears things out and makes navigation easier.
